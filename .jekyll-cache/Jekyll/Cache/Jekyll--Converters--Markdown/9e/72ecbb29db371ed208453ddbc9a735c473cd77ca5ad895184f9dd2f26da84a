<p>Hi, I’m Jack. I’m currently a graduate student studying bioinformatics. One of
areas I’m particularly focused on is (biological) data processing,
visualization, and accessibility. Additionally, I do a lot of integrative
analysis using different types of biological data.</p>

<p>In my free time, I’m on involved in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a>.
There, I’m heavily involved in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">Chalk</a> and
co-lead the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-traits/">traits working group</a>.</p>
